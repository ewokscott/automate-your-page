  </p>  
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
	Basics:-
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
  	We use a language called HTML to write web pages. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>.
    We use a protocol called HTTP to transfer web pages to our browser. HTTP stands for <em>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</em>
    The WWW <em>(World Wide Web)</em> was invented in 1990 and has around 30 Billion pages
	</p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title"> 
  Some HTML we learned about:-
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
  	<em>Anchors</em>:- Used to insert links into web pages
      <br>
   	<em>Void Tags</em>:- A tag with no closing tag such as "br"
    	<br>
    <em>Inline tags</em>:- Tags that are displayed "inline" on the web page, such as "em" and "span"
    	<br>
    <em>Block tags</em>:- Tags that have a shape that forms a box around the content, such as "p" and "div"
  </p>
 </div>
 
<div class="sub_title">
  Some Examples:-
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
	<p>	
		This is written with a div tag. It adds a break (new line) at the end, it's a block tag
		We can also use a span tag. There is no new line added at the end of this tag, it's an inline tag
	</p>  
	
	<p>
		This is an example of an <a href="http://www.att.com"><em>anchor link</em></a>
  </p>

<!-- These are the Lesson 2 notes -->
<div class="main_title">
  How we write HTML:-
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
  	Front End Web Development is all about boxes. Even circles are boxes!
		We learned how to use the developer tools in Chrome to analyze the style of the elements and to see the tree structure
	</p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p> 
  	We are using editors like Sublime Text and scratchpad.io to create our HTML
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
	<p> 
  	It's important to use structure in our webpages so they are easy to read and to debug. We need to use indentation to identify the tree structure and to see how elements are nested
  </p>
</div>

<!-- These are the lesson 3 notes -->
<div class="main_title">
  CSS Notes:-
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
	<p>
  	CSS is used to control the style of HTML elements. CSS is based on inheritance. This allows us to use CSS to reduce code used when declaring properties of elements. We try and avoid repetition because it saves on code when we reuse, and it's easier to debug.
  	The CSS developer guide is located <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference"><em>here</em></a>.
  	CSS format is selector:property:value.
  </p>  	
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
	<p>
  	We can include CSS in 3 ways:-
  	  <ul>
   	  	<li>In the head of the HTML</li>
  	  	<li>Link to a separate CSS file</li> 
  	  	<li>Write style inline with the HTML</li>
  	  </ul>
  <p>

  <p>
  	In CSS code comments begin with /* and end with */
  </p>

	<p>
		Each HTML element is a box, and each box has 4 components. We can set the size of the box using pixels, percentage or the box-sizing attribute to border-box
  </p>
  		
  <p>
  	When writing CSS use the theory - Code, Test, Refine. 1) Look for natural boxes. 2) Look for repeated styles. 3) Write the HTML. 4) Apply styles from biggest to smallest. 5) Fix things.
  </p>
  		
  <p>
  	To verify HTML we use <a href=" http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input"><em>HTML Verify</em></a>
  </p>

<div class="main_title">
  <p>
    Stage 2: Introduction to Serious Programming:-
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is a computer?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p> 
    A computer executes programs to do many different things. The program itself tells the computer what to do. A computer without a program is useless.
  </p>
</div>  

<div class="sub_title">
  What is a program and what are programming languages?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    A program is a precise sequence of steps that tells a computer what to do. Programming languages are the different ways in which we create programs. An example we use here is called Python. 
    Here is a link to the Python website <a href="https://www.python.org/"><em>Python.org</em></a>
  </p>
</div>
 
<div class="sub_title"> 
  What are Python expressions?
</div>
 
 <div class="sub_title_description"> 
  <p> 
    An expression in python is what follows the python command, it's something that has a value.It can be a number or a string for example. The python statements need to have an exact grammar. An example of a python statement is "print 5 + 6". Print is the command, 5 and 6 are the expressions and + is the operator. The command will print the answer 11 to the screen.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is an interpreter?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    An interpreter takes programs we have written as input, and then outputs them in a program that the computer itself will understand. We write our program in python code, that then gets passed to the python interpreter that sits on the computer and that in turn translates the python code into a language the computer can understand.  
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main_title">
  <p>
    Stage 2: Variables and Strings:-
  </p>  
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is a variable?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    A variable is a way of assigning a name to a value. This makes it simpler to interpret the code. The value of the variable can vary depending on the value we assign it.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">    
  What does it mean to assign a value to a variable?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    We use an assignment statement to give a variable a value. It uses the format variable_name = expression. We can use a # to insert a comment. Everything following the # is ignored by the interpreter.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is the difference between the equals sign in math vs programming?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    The = sign in programming means assignment. We evaluate whats on the right of the sign, and assign that value to the variable on the left of the sign.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is a string?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    A string is a sequence of characters, suc as text, between the quote symbols. It can be enclosed in single or double quotes, but we can't mix in the same string, they must start and end with the same quote type. "This is a string" is an example of a string.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Indexing Strings
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    We can index a string to extract a character from a string. The indexes start at 0 and count from left to right. We can also index using - numbers and they will count from right to left starting at -1. 
    Example:- string = "tester", new_string = string[0:3], new_string will equal test as we extracted the first 4 characters.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Finding strings in strings
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    We can use the built in fuction of python called find. When we search for a target string within a string the find function will return the position in the string that our target string starts in. If the target string is not found in the string then -1 is returned from the find function.
  </p>      
</div>   

<div class="main_title">
  <p>
    Stage 2: Input -> Function -> Output:-
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is a function?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    We use a function to perform a repetitive task. We can perform the same function many times with different inputs to get a different result. This helps us avoid repetition in our code.
  </p>
  <p> The format is &lt name of function&gt(input1,input2):. The inputs are called operands or arguments. The function is "defined" using a def statement and the return statement specifies what to return when the function is invoked. When we execute the function the interpreter jumps to where the fucntion is defined, executes the function using the inputs supplied and jumps back to the line the function was called from. If no return statement is listed then the function really does nothing as it can't return any value.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Function inputs.
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    Inputs are used as parameters for functions. The actual values of the inputs cannot be changed by the function. Inputs of string or integer are called <em>immutable</em>. This means that once we have declared the variable of that type nothing in the function can change that value. We should use meaningful names for our inputs so we can tell what thay actually mean rather than just random naming.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">  
  Example of a function.
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    This is a function that will takes 2 strings as inputs and returns a string that is the first input followed by the second input twice, followed by the first input.
  </p>

  <p>def abbaize(word1,word2):<br>
     return word1+word2+word2+word1
  <br>
  print abbaize("dog","cat")
  >>> "dogcatcatdog"
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Making and using functions?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    There is a distinct difference between making and using a function. Making a function means the actual specification of the function itself, such as the function name and the input names. Using a function means execution of the function using the input values we pass to the function. 
  </p>
</div>  

<div class="main_title">  
  <p>
    Stage 2: Decisions and repetition - If and While:-
  </p>  
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Operators
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    We use mathematic operators to make decisions. Standard operators like &lt, &gt, are used as well as == for equality and != for non equality. We need to use 2 equals signs when using equality as the single equals sign means assignment. 
  </p>  
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Or operator
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    We use the or operator when we want to evaluate against 2 expressions. The or is a bit different to other operators as it doesnt have to evaulate the whole construct, it can evaluate as soon as it meets a match in the construct
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Loops
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    A loop is a way to do things over and over. We can use the while statement for a loop, it keeps going all the while the test expression is true.
    We can also put a break statement in. Break will give us a way to stop the loop even if the test expression is true. If we execute a loop with a break we can exit the loop when the test expression for the break is true.
  </p>
</div>  

<div class="main_title">
  <p>    
    Stage 2: Debugging:-
  </p>  
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  What is a bug?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    A bug is an error in the code. Having bugs is a normal part of writing code. Debugging is what we do to correct the bugs.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  How do we know when we have a bug?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>  
    When our program has a bug the interpreter will throw an error. It won't say exactly what is wrong, but it will often give some pointers. The error displayed in Python is called a traceback. It gives information like line number and function name as well as the error to help us debug the code.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  How do we debug?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    We debug in a couple of ways. We can comment out parts of the code and do step by step modifications until it works. We can also insert print statements to see the value of variables in functions to help us see where the error may be coming from.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">   
  Version control
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    It's very important to have version control in our code. We need to keep old copies of the code so we have fallbacks in case the modifications we have made don't work.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main_title">
  <p>
    Stage 2: Structured Data: Lists and For Loops
  </p>  
</div>

<div class="sub_title">  
  What is a list?
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    A string is a sequence of characters, wereas a list can be a sequence of anything. We use quotes to enclose a string. We use square brackets to enlcose a list and the elements in the list are separated by commas.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">  
  Nested lists
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    Lists can have lists within lists, these are called nested lists. This makes them versatile and we can group related data in a list inside a nested list. We use a comma to separate lists in a nested list to maintain structure. We access elements within nested lists using multiple square brackets with the index numbers. Lists are indexed starting from 0.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  Mutation
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    Mutation is changing the value of a list after we have created it. We can change an index of a list by putting the new value on the right side of the assignment operator. Example - <em>p[0] = "Y" </em> will assign character Y to index 0 of list p.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">     
  Aliasing
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    Aliasing means two different ways to refer to the same object. When we make a change to a list it will also change the value in any lists that object is related to. For example we have an element called p and we make q equal to p. If we then go and change an element of q it will also change the same element in p. If we change all elements then thats a new value and the aliasing isn't done as the objects aren't linked anymore.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">  
  List Operations
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    Append:- Append adds a new element to the end of a list. It's called using the list.append command. Append mutates the input list meaning the appended element is added to the input list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Plus +:- + is concatenation for lists. It does not mutate the input list like append does. It creates a new list with the concatenated lists.
  </p>

  <p>
    Len: Len returns the number of elements in a list. Len only returns the outer elemenst of nested lists. We can also use len to return the number of characters in a string.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">
  For Loops
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    A for loop introduces a new variable that represents name. The name variable is assigned each element in the list in turn and the block of code inside the loop is applied to it
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main_title">
  <p>
    Stage 2: How to Solve Problems
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">  
  Understanding a problem
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    A computational problem is defined by a set of possible inputs and the desired outputs. The solution is a procedure that gives the desired outputs based on the inputs. The first rule in solving a problem is to understand the possible inputs.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">      
  Solving a problem
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">  
  <p>
    When solving a problem we should use the concept described in the following steps.
      <ul>
        <li>What are the inputs?</li>
        <li>What are the outputs?</li>
        <li>Work through some examples by hand.</li>
        <li>Devise a simple mechanical solution.</li>
        <li>Develop the solution incrementally and test as we go</li>
      </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="sub_title">        
  Assertions
</div>

<div class="sub_title_description">
  <p>
    An assertion is a statement in python that helps the programmer see if the inputs or outputs match the defined values. We use it to make sure our inputs are valid. It's written like:- <em>assert (year2 >= year1)</em> . This is testing to make sure year2 is >= to year 1. If the condition is not met [unexpected input], then an AssertionError is raised by the interpreter.
  </p>
